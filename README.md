This project was created with Java Spring Boot, React, and Angular. This is a demonstration of how to use Java as a back end server that takes in and serves up information for the front end (React or Angular).

## The Back End

The back end was created using Java Spring Boot. All of the files you need for the back end are found in the "java-backend" folder. Simply open this folder and launch the code with an application like Spring Tools Suite 4.

This back end application (once running) will handle all storing and retrieving of post and user data. It will handle the creation of users, the encrpytion of their passwords, the JWT token authentication, and the modifying or deletion of users. It will also handle the creation, deletion, and modification of posts. 

### PLEASE NOTE you will need MYSQL installed and the correct username and password entered into the Java back end files


## Angular Front End

The Angular front end is found in the "angular" folder. Simply navigate to this folder, run `npm install` to install the node_modules, and then run `ng serve` to launch the application. 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` (make sure your back end is successfully up and running). You should now be able to register, login, create posts, and view posts.


## React Front End
The React front end is found in the "react" folder. Simply navigate to this folder, run `npm install` to install the node_modules, and then run `npm start` to launch the application.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser (make sure your back end is successfully up and running). You should now be able to register, login, create posts, and view posts.
